# Visual Anomaly Detection and Segmentation for Manufacturing Inspection
Created an efficient convolutional autoencoder by unsupervised training on images of good products using ADAM,
RMSprop optimizers for feature reconstruction which can detect and segment anomaly regions.
• Achieved maximum ROC score of 99.1 for a class and F1 score of 0.95 on MVtec anomaly detection dataset.
